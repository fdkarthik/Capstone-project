Credit Card Fraud Detection Project Results

Data Set Description:

The dataset includes transactions made by credit card holders. It consists of 284,807transactions, out of which only 492 transactions are marked as fraudulent (0.172%).
Project Objectives:
Objective 1: Perform in-depth analysis on the dataset to identify potential fraudulenttransactions. Objective 2: Visualize and compare fraudulent and genuine transactions based onvarious features. Objective 3: Implement machine learning models to detect fraudulent activitiesand evaluate their performance metrics. Objective 4: Handle class imbalances using samplingtechniques or class weights to improve model performance.

Technologies Used:
Python (Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) Machine Learning Libraries (Scikit-learn,TensorFlow, Keras, etc.) Data Visualization Tools

Project Steps:
Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
Understand and preprocess the dataset, dealing with missing values and outliers. Identifyfeatures that differentiate fraudulent and genuine transactions.
Visualize fraudulent and genuine transaction.
Apply machine learning algorithms to train the dataset. Evaluate model performance usingmetrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Perform hyperparameter tuning andoverfitting prevention techniques.
Test the trained model on real data to assess its ability to correctly identify fraudulenttransactions. Review and focus on improving the model's performance.
Periodically update the model with new data to create a more resilient model against evolvingfraudulent tactics.
Implement appropriate measures to ensure data security and privacy due to the sensitive natureof the data.

1. Data Preprocessing: The preprocessing phase involved handling missing values and
outliers, which significantly improved the quality of the data, making it more suitable for
analysis.
2. Feature Scaling: Applying normalization and standardization techniques to the features
resulted in enhanced model performance and better convergence during the training
process.
3. Resampling Techniques: Using both oversampling and undersampling methods helped in
creating a balanced class distribution, preventing the model from being biased towards the
majority class.
4. Model Selection: Testing various algorithms such as logistic regression and random forest
allowed us to identify the best-performing model that provided the most accurate
predictions for fraud detection.
5. Neural Network Architecture: The implementation of a deep learning model with multiple
layers enabled the system to learn intricate patterns within the data, leading to highly
accurate predictions for fraud detection.
